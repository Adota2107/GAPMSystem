### Description

### Commit Types and Descriptions

We use the following commit types:

*   **feat:** Introduces a new feature to the application. Should be used when adding significant functionality.

    *   Example: `feat: Implement user authentication`

*   **fix:** Corrects a bug in the application.  Use this for bug fixes, hotfixes, and patches.

    *   Example: `fix: Resolve issue with form submission`

*   **chore:** Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, such as updating dependencies, configuration files, or build scripts.  Also used for general housekeeping tasks.

    *   Example: `chore: Update dependencies to latest versions`

*   **docs:** Updates to the documentation, including READMEs, API docs, or other documentation files.

    *   Example: `docs: Add instructions for setting up the development environment`

*   **style:** Changes that do not affect the logic of the code, but improve its readability or style, such as formatting, whitespace changes, or linting fixes.

    *   Example: `style: Apply code formatting according to PEP 8`

*   **refactor:** A code change that neither adds nor removes functionality, but improves the internal structure or design of the code, e.g., renaming variables, extracting methods, or simplifying logic.

    *   Example: `refactor: Extract database connection logic into a separate module`

*   **test:** Adding or modifying tests.

    *   Example: `test: Add unit tests for the new feature`

*   **build:** Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example: npm, gradle, maven, pip).

    *   Example: `build: Upgrade Gradle version`

*   **ci:** Changes related to the continuous integration system (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Travis CI).

    *   Example: `ci: Configure automatic deployment to staging environment`

*   **perf:** A code change that improves performance.

    *   Example: `perf: Optimize database queries for faster response times`

*   **revert:** Reverts a previous commit.

    *   Example: `revert: Revert "feat: Implement user authentication" due to unforeseen issues`
